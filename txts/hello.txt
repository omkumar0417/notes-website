Operating systems (OS) manage computer hardware and software resources.  
They provide a user interface for interacting with the machine.  
Popular OS examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
An OS handles memory management and process scheduling.  
File systems are organized and maintained by the OS.  
Security and user authentication are core OS responsibilities.  
Device drivers allow the OS to communicate with hardware.  
Multitasking is enabled by modern operating systems.  
Updates and patches keep the OS secure and efficient.  
Without an OS, most computers would be unusable for everyday tasks.
